## 🧠 How It Works

### 1️⃣ User selects a movie  
### 2️⃣ Similarity scores are computed  
### 3️⃣ Top 5 most similar movies are selected  
### 4️⃣ Posters are fetched from TMDB API  
### 5️⃣ Results are displayed in a modern UI  

---

## 🤖 Machine Learning Approach

This system uses **Content-Based Filtering**, where:

- Movie metadata is vectorized  
- Cosine similarity calculates closeness  
- Movies with highest similarity are recommended  

📌 Ensures **personalized & relevant** results
